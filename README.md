# Paper Review
- Paper: [Stroke-Based Scene Text Erasing Using Synthetic Data for Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11493v3.pdf)
- We propose a practical text erasing method and a strokebased text-erasing network using cropped text images instead of the entire image, which makes prediction of the pixel-level mask of text strokes more accurate and stable.
## Dataset
- To allow the network to learn the complicated distribution of scene texts, a considerable number of manually text-erased realworld images are required as training data because *the text distribution of the Synth-text dataset, which is generated according to human rules, is significantly different from realworld cases.*
- we trained our model only on the dataset generated by the improved synthetic text engine in an end-to-end fashion.
