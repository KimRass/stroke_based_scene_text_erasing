- Paper: [Stroke-Based Scene Text Erasing Using Synthetic Data for Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11493v3.pdf)
- We propose a practical text erasing method and a strokebased text-erasing network using cropped text images instead of the entire image, which makes prediction of the pixel-level mask of text strokes more accurate and stable.
